# Simulation

To be able to send custom error messages, I used a program called [message_sender_bot.rb](https://github.com/ZhichunLu-11/Channel-prototype/blob/master/message_sender_bot/message_sender_bot.rb), whose only function is to send messages. Different JSON files describe different interactions.
